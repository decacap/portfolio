Optimizing a portfolio involves finding the best combination of assets to achieve a specific set of goals, such as maximizing returns or minimizing risk. There are several techniques that can be used to optimize a portfolio, including:

1. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT): This technique was developed by Harry Markowitz and is based on the idea that an optimal portfolio can be constructed by balancing risk and return. MPT takes into account the expected return of each asset in the portfolio, as well as the correlation between the assets. This helps to ensure that the portfolio is diversified and has an appropriate mix of assets.
2. Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO): This is a mathematical technique that uses statistical analysis to optimize a portfolio. MVO takes into account the expected return of each asset, as well as the standard deviation of the returns. The goal is to find the portfolio that has the highest expected return for a given level of risk.
3. Black-Litterman Model: This technique combines the views of investors with the statistical analysis of MVO. The model starts with the market portfolio and adjusts it based on the views of the investors. This helps to ensure that the portfolio is customized to the specific goals and risk tolerance of the investors.
4. Monte Carlo Simulation: This technique involves running thousands of simulations of different portfolio combinations to determine the probability of achieving a specific set of goals. Monte Carlo simulation takes into account the expected return and volatility of each asset, as well as the correlation between the assets.

Overall, the choice of technique will depend on the specific goals and risk tolerance of the investor, as well as the complexity of the portfolio.

What would be a good method to find assets to add to a portfolio ?

There are different methods to find assets to add to a portfolio, depending on the investment strategy, risk appetite, and other factors. Here are some common approaches:

1. Fundamental Analysis: This approach involves analyzing the financial and economic factors that affect the performance of an asset, such as revenue growth, earnings, debt levels, industry trends, macroeconomic conditions, etc. The goal is to identify undervalued or overvalued assets that have potential for long-term growth or income.
2. Technical Analysis: This approach involves analyzing the price and volume trends of an asset, using charts, indicators, and other tools. The goal is to identify patterns and signals that indicate the direction and momentum of the market, and to make trading decisions based on those signals.
3. Quantitative Analysis: This approach involves using mathematical models and statistical techniques to analyze large amounts of data, such as financial statements, market data, and economic indicators. The goal is to identify patterns and relationships that can be used to predict future performance and optimize the portfolio.
4. Index Investing: This approach involves investing in a diversified portfolio that tracks a market index, such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The goal is to achieve broad exposure to the market and to minimize the risk of individual stock picking.
5. Socially Responsible Investing: This approach involves investing in assets that align with the investor's values and beliefs, such as environmental sustainability, social justice, or corporate governance. The goal is to achieve financial returns while also making a positive impact on society and the environment.

Ultimately, the choice of method depends on the investor's goals, preferences, and expertise. It's important to conduct thorough research and analysis before making any investment decisions, and to diversify the portfolio across different asset classes and sectors to minimize risk.

Additionally, portfolio optimization is a complex and dynamic field, and this code represents a basic implementation. Further considerations such as transaction costs, slippage, and other risk factors may need to be incorporated for a more realistic portfolio optimization. So, it is important to thoroughly understand the assumptions and limitations of the code.
